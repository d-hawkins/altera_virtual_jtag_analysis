# Introduction

This repository contains the original version of the Altera Virtual JTAG analysis document created using Altera Quartus II 11.1sp1 in November 2011. The repository contains the internal details of the Altera Virtual JTAG components, and is referenced by the JTAG-to-Avalon Analysis document that I also uploaded to github in May 2023 (see https://github.com/d-hawkins/altera_jtag_to_avalon_analysis).
